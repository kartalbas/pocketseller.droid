# Serialization

RestSharp has JSON and XML serializers built in.

:::tip
The default behavior of RestSharp is to swallow deserialization errors and return `null` in the `Data`
property of the response. Read more about it in the [Error Handling](error-handling.md).
:::

## JSON

The default JSON serializer uses `System.Text.Json`, which is a part of .NET since .NET 6. For earlier versions, it is added as a dependency. There are also a few serializers provided as additional packages.

By default, RestSharp will use `JsonSerializerDefaults.Web` configuration. If necessary, you can specify your own options:

```csharp
client.UseSystemTextJson(new JsonSerializerOptions {...});
```

## XML

The default XML serializer is `DotNetXmlSerializer`, which uses `System.Xml.Serialization` library from .NET.

In previous versions of RestSharp, the default XML serializer was a custom RestSharp XML serializer. To make the code library size smaller, that serializer is now available as a separate package [`RestSharp.Serializers.Xml`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RestSharp.Serializers.Xml).
You can add it back if necessary by installing the package and adding it to the client:

```csharp
client.UseXmlSerializer();
```

As before, you can supply three optional arguments for a custom namespace, custom root element, and if you want to use `SerializeAs` and `DeserializeAs` attributed.

## NewtonsoftJson (aka Json.Net)

The `NewtonsoftJson` package is the most popular JSON serializer for .NET. It handles all possible scenarios and is very configurable. Such a flexibility comes with the cost of performance. If you need speed, keep the default JSON serializer.

RestSharp support Json.Net serializer via a separate package [`RestSharp.Serializers.NewtonsoftJson`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RestSharp.Serializers.NewtonsoftJson).

::: warning
Please note that `RestSharp.Newtonsoft.Json` package is not provided by RestSharp, is marked as obsolete on NuGet, and no longer supported by its creator.
:::

Use the extension method provided by the package to configure the client:

```csharp
client.UseNewtonsoftJson();
```

The serializer configures some options by default:

```csharp
JsonSerializerSettings DefaultSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings {
    ContractResolver     = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver(),
    DefaultValueHandling = DefaultValueHandling.Include,
    TypeNameHandling     = TypeNameHandling.None,
    NullValueHandling    = NullValueHandling.Ignore,
    Formatting           = Formatting.None,
    ConstructorHandling  = ConstructorHandling.AllowNonPublicDefaultConstructor
};
```

If you need to use different settings, you can supply your instance of
`JsonSerializerSettings` as a parameter for the extension method.

## Custom

You can also implement your custom serializer. To support both serialization and
deserialization, you must implement the `IRestSerializer` interface.

Here is an example of a custom serializer that uses `System.Text.Json`:

```csharp
public class SimpleJsonSerializer : IRestSerializer {
    public string Serialize(object obj) => JsonSerializer.Serialize(obj);

    public string Serialize(Parameter bodyParameter) => Serialize(bodyParameter.Value);

    public T Deserialize<T>(IRestResponse response) => JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T>(response.Content);

    public string[] SupportedContentTypes { get; } = {
        "application/json", "text/json", "text/x-json", "text/javascript", "*+json"
    };

    public string ContentType { get; set; } = "application/json";

    public DataFormat DataFormat { get; } = DataFormat.Json;
}
```

The value of the `SupportedContentTypes` property will be used to match the
serializer with the response `Content-Type` headers.

The `ContentType` property will be used when making a request so the
server knows how to handle the payload.
